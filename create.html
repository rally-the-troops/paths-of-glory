        Based on some discussions and testing at the 2016 World Boardgaming Championships, it was proposed that a
        preannounced specific substitution of optional cards with cards in the standard POG decks, backed up by
        competitive game play experience, will support introducing these cards into organized play.
    <p>These substitutions have been carefully selected to preserve overall play balance.
        Benefits include: Increasing each players’ decks by 1 OP per deck, eliminate cards that are viewed as ‘less
        valuable’ or see little usage, and create opportunities for new strategies.
